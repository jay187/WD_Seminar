        <p>Formally known as the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the movement was actually born during the waning days of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Many senators were unhappy with Chancellor Palpatine‘s extended duration of emergency powers. Several senators in particular, including Padme Amidala, Mon Mothma, and Bail Organa took effort to bring democracy back to the Republic.</p>
        <p>At the end of the Clone Wars and Order 66, however, Palpatine reorganized the Republic into a Galactic Empire with himself as Emperor. The Imperial Senate was now filled with sycophants and anyone who opposed the changes faced harsh reprisal.  As a result, no one in the government opposed the massive military buildup. Some isolated areas, such as the planets Ryloth and Lothal, rebelled against the Empire, but an organized resistance had yet to be formed.</p>

        <p>Bail Organa, with assistance of the ex-Jedi Ahsoka Tano posing as the shadowy figure “Fulcrum,” created a network to organize various resistance cells across the Galaxy. By 19 years after the Empire’s establishment, the Rebel Alliance was now a formal organization with Mon Mothma as its leader. They gained better hardware such as X-Wings and A-Wings and strong military leaders such as Jan Dodonna and Admiral Ackbar. Senator Princess Leia also became a prominent figure.</p>
        <p>With the completion of the Death Star, the Empire sought to destroy the Alliance’s home base at Yavin IV after the destruction of Alderaan and Bail Organa. Thankfully, the plans to the station were stolen and returned to the Alliance. In the ensuring battle, Luke Skywalker managed to destroy the station using a critical flaw in its design.</p>

          The Empire’s reprisal was swift and devastating, chasing the Rebels from Yavin and across the galaxy. Three years later, the Rebels had established a new outpost: Echo Base on Hoth. However, after an extensive search the Empire discovered their location and laid siege to the planet. Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles led the pilots of Rogue Squadron in snowspeeders, buying the Rebels time to evacuate. They were successful, but the Rebels once again suffered heavy losses and were without a centralized base of operations.</span>
        <p style="float: left;">In the year that followed, the Alliance discovered that the Empire was building a second Death Star in orbit of Endor. They gathered a large fleet near Sullust and conducted an operation to destroy the Death Star and kill the Emperor. However, it was a trap designed to destroy the Alliance once and for all. Despite the odds being stacked against them, the Alliance was victorious. The second Death Star was destroyed, along with the Emperor and Darth Vader.</p>
        <span>Shortly after their victory at Endor, the Rebel Alliance formally reorganized into the New Republic and carried on their fight against the shattered Empire.</span>
